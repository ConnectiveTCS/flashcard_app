Explain the concept of a digital device and its fundamental operating principle,"A digital device is any equipment containing a computer or microcontroller that processes electronic signals representing one (“on”) or zero (“off”). Each “on” or “off” state is a bit (binary digit), and eight bits make a byte. These devices interpret patterns of bits to perform computation and control functions in everything from smartphones and watches to refrigerators and automobiles.",FIT152 - Topic 2: Hardware and Digital Devices (PR)
Describe how bit-width affects a digital device’s performance.,"Bit-width refers to how many bits a processor can handle simultaneously. Early PCs processed 8 bits at once; modern CPUs may process 64 or 128 bits in parallel. A larger bit-width allows more data to be processed per clock cycle, improving overall performance and enabling more complex operations.",FIT152 - Topic 2: Hardware and Digital Devices (PR)
Compare the base-ten (decimal) numbering system to the base-two (binary) system.,"Decimal (base-ten): each digit represents a power of ten (10⁰, 10¹, 10², etc.); for example, 1 0 1 0₁₀  (1×10³)+(0×10²)+(1×10¹)+(0×10⁰)  1010.
– Binary (base-two): each digit represents a power of two (2⁰, 2¹, 2², etc.); for example, 1 0 1 0₂  (1×2³)+(0×2²)+(1×2¹)+(0×2⁰)  8+0+2+0  10₁₀. Computers use binary because electronic circuits easily distinguish two states (on/off).",FIT152 - Topic 2: Hardware and Digital Devices (PR)
List the standard binary prefixes from kilo to yotta and their approximate values in bytes.,"kilo (k): 10³ ≈ 1 000 bytes
– mega (M): 10⁶ ≈ 1 000 000 bytes
– giga (G): 10⁹ ≈ 1 000 000 000 bytes

Discuss why everyday objects like cars and refrigerators are now considered digital devices.,"Many everyday objects now incorporate microcontrollers or embedded computers to manage functions (for example engine control units in cars or temperature regulation in smart refrigerators). Because they process binary signals and run software to perform tasks, these objects qualify as digital devices, blurring the line between traditional “computer hardware” and consumer appliances.",FIT152 - Topic 2: Hardware and Digital Devices (PR)
Define engineered systems and give three examples of where they appear in modern life.,"Engineered systems are artificial (non-natural) constructs designed by humans to perform organized functions. Examples include:
– Transportation systems (for example railways, airports)
– Energy production and distribution systems (for example power grids)
– Communication systems (for example cellular networks, the Internet)
– Industrial control systems (for example manufacturing assembly lines)",FIT152 - Topic 2: Systems Architecture and Emergence (PR)
Explain why modern engineered systems are characterized by both high complexity and strong interdependence.,"Modern systems integrate many subsystems and components whose behaviors interact in non-linear ways. Increased functionality and connectivity (for example digital control in automobiles, smart grids) mean that a change or failure in one part can propagate, making the overall system behavior harder to predict and control.",FIT152 - Topic 2: Systems Architecture and Emergence (PR)
Define the concept of emergence in system integration and illustrate it with the brick-and-wall example.,"Emergence is when an integrated system exhibits properties not present in its individual parts. In the brick-and-wall example:
– A brick alone provides structural support and light absorption.
– A wall of unbonded bricks only absorbs light.
– A properly constructed wall “emerges” with new properties (for example shape, windows that allow light passage) that cannot be deduced from a single brick’s properties.",FIT152 - Topic 2: Systems Architecture and Emergence (PR)
Why is a dedicated system architect essential for complex system design?,"Controlling individual components does not guarantee control of the whole system due to emergent behaviors. A system architect oversees the high-level integration model, ensuring coherent interconnection of subsystems, managing emergence, and aligning the overall structure with requirements and constraints. Without this role, organizations risk uncontrolled complexity and unpredictable system behaviors.",FIT152 - Topic 2: Systems Architecture and Emergence (PR)
Describe one challenge in developing a holistic “science of systems” (systemics).,"Systemics must integrate knowledge from many disciplines (for example engineering, computer science, organizational theory), each with its own methods and terminology. Bringing these together into coherent models that capture emergence and interdependence is difficult, as traditional disciplines focus on optimizing subsystems rather than entire integrated systems.",FIT152 - Topic 2: Systems Architecture and Emergence (PR)
Summarize how the foreword positions “systemics” as a new scientific and technical discipline.,"Systemics is proposed as the rigorous study of engineered systems’ architecture, complexity and emergence. It extends beyond component optimization to address integration processes, require new modeling paradigms and cross-disciplinary collaboration, and demands formal recognition (for example system architect roles, academic programs) to tackle modern systemic challenges.",FIT152 - Topic 2: Systems Architecture and Emergence (PR)
Explain what differentiates a “system” from a mere group of interacting elements.,"A system is created by applying an integration operator to disparate elements, producing a unique unit whose functional capabilities—its “service contract” exposed via external interfaces—emerge only at the system level. Unlike a simple group, the system’s new functions are more than the sum of its parts and can be used without knowledge of its internal construction.",FIT152 - Topic 2: System Integration and Emergence (PR)
Describe the two complementary aspects of an integrated system.,"1. Functional (logical, atemporal): The system’s behaviors and services (“what it does”) that exceed those of individual components.",FIT152 - Topic 2: System Integration and Emergence (PR)
,"2. Physical (material, temporal): The tangible structure and components that realize those functions in the real world, subject to energy constraints and environmental “noise.”",FIT152 - Topic 2: System Integration and Emergence (PR)
Define a “system of systems” and explain how its integration differs from that of a single system.,"A “system of systems” is a hierarchy of integrated units, each potentially a complete system, combined at a higher level. Integration among these units is looser than within a single system. The components share a common exchange model (for example information protocols) that enables coordination without tight coupling.",FIT152 - Topic 2: System Integration and Emergence (PR)
Summarize why the 1990s–2010s marked a revolution in system architecture.,"Advances in miniaturization and component integration in the 1980s enabled distributed computation. In the 1990s, defense and security applications adopted loosely coupled “system of systems” architectures. With the Internet and World Wide Web becoming ubiquitous in the 2000s, this integration motif—relying on shared information exchange models—became central across industries, amplifying system complexity and interdependence.",FIT152 - Topic 2: System Integration and Emergence (PR)
Explain the role of an “exchange model” in system integration.,"An exchange model defines the common information structures and protocols that allow heterogeneous components or subsystems to interoperate and be integrable. By standardizing data formats, messages or interfaces, the exchange model ensures that the integration operator can bind parts into a coherent system or system of systems.",FIT152 - Topic 2: System Integration and Emergence (PR)
Discuss why error management is now a core concern in complex system design.,"As systems grow in complexity—especially their functional (software) components—errors become inevitable at scale. These faults can cause malfunctions with severe consequences. System safety must therefore be built in, designing architectures that are robust (resist faults) and resilient (recover from faults), ensuring autonomy and dependable operation under real-world hazards.",FIT152 - Topic 2: System Integration and Emergence (PR)
Define cybernetics as introduced by Norbert Wiener.,"Cybernetics is the science of control and communication in animals and machines. It studies feedback loops and how systems use information about their outputs to regulate their behavior toward a goal. Wiener chose the term from the Greek κυβερνητική (steersmanship) to emphasize purposeful, adaptive steering of systems.",FIT152 - Topic 2: The Legacy of Norbert Wiener and the Birth of Cybernetics (PR)
Explain the concept of a metamodel and its relevance in cybernetics.,"A metamodel is an abstract model of a model. In cybernetics, the “model” of a target system (for example ballistics equations) is implemented as a program; the metamodel describes the rules and structure of those programs themselves, enabling re-use across different physical media (for example analog circuits or digital code).",FIT152 - Topic 2: The Legacy of Norbert Wiener and the Birth of Cybernetics (PR)
State Wiener’s “law no. 2” about system–environment interaction.,"To interact effectively with an environment, a system must possess an abstract model of that environment, independent of physical media. This model provides the “map” needed for purposeful action.",FIT152 - Topic 2: The Legacy of Norbert Wiener and the Birth of Cybernetics (PR)
Illustrate how Wiener’s anti-aircraft work exemplified cybernetic principles.,"Radar provided real-time target data (position, speed, acceleration) as feedback
– Servomechanisms adjusted gun aim using transfer functions to follow moving targets
– Predictive ballistics models (“metamodels”) calculated fusing sensor data to time shell bursts
– Continuous feedback loop of sensor→model→actuator underlay the control architecture",FIT152 - Topic 2: The Legacy of Norbert Wiener and the Birth of Cybernetics (PR)
Describe the role of feedback in cybernetic systems.,"Feedback channels return part of a system’s output to its input, allowing continuous correction. By comparing desired versus actual outputs, the system adjusts its behavior to reduce error and maintain goal achievement despite disturbances.",FIT152 - Topic 2: The Legacy of Norbert Wiener and the Birth of Cybernetics (PR)
Contrast the United States and France in early cybernetic adoption.,"United States: Cybernetics was integrated into engineering via MIT’s SAGE, Forrester’s Industrial Dynamics, systems engineering programs and the “Fifth Discipline.”
- France: Early enthusiasm faltered as cybernetic jargon outpaced rigor, and broad social applications met skepticism; it remained marginal in engineering curricula.",FIT152 - Topic 2: The Legacy of Norbert Wiener and the Birth of Cybernetics (PR)
Why did Wiener prefer “machine learning” over “artificial intelligence”?,"Wiener used “machine learning” (coined 1946) to emphasize adaptive, feedback-based behavior without the grandiose connotations of “artificial intelligence,” which risked promising more than the technology could deliver.",FIT152 - Topic 2: The Legacy of Norbert Wiener and the Birth of Cybernetics (PR)
Summarize the “double trajectory” concept in cybernetic steering.,"Steering involves two intertwined dynamics:
– Environmental dynamics: Uncontrolled external forces (wind, currents) that must be modeled (“epigenetic landscape”).
– System dynamics: The system’s own control actions based on its internal model and past experience.
Effective navigation uses both to optimize the path from A to B.",FIT152 - Topic 2: The Legacy of Norbert Wiener and the Birth of Cybernetics (PR)
Define the strategic roles of information systems in large organizations.,"provide a permanently available online store to customers
- Automate business Processes to reduce costs and improve efficiency due to globalization
- enable senior executives to monitor activities and react quickly In fast-moving markets by reducing time to market",FIT152 - Topic 2: Conflicting Requirements in Information Systems (PR)
Discuss why information systems often grow like “living organisms” rather than being designed to last.,"They must adapt to fluctuating, contradictory forces in an open environment
- User base grows (employees, IT personnel, customers) and their demands increase simultaneously
- Continuous pressure for new features, performance, reliability, and user experience",
Explain the conflict between flexibility and reliability in IS design.,"Flexibility requires meeting unclear, changing requirements and stakeholder customization; demands agility and fast turnaround
- Reliability requires lengthy design, deep subsystem understanding, extensive testing, and feedback—building human understanding slowly
- Brute-force resource allocation can improve speed but cannot guarantee flexibility or sustainable reliability",
Identify two additional factors that exacerbate complexity in information systems.,"Successive technological hype (e.g. Enterprise Application Integration, Service-Oriented Architecture, Enterprise JavaBeans, Master Data Management) leading to uncontrolled complexity
- High turnover of key technical or business staff seeking better environments, causing knowledge loss",
Explain why an uncontrolled increase in entropy of computing systems is undesirable.,"Chaos (unpredictability) emerges: nobody understands system behavior, data structure, or hardware processes
- Responsibility for decisions or changes is avoided
- Mapping efforts start IS architecture projects because existing structure is unknown, defeating the IS purpose of sound decision-making",
