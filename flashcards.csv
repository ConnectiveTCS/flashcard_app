Explain the concept of a digital device and its fundamental operating principle,"A digital device is any equipment containing a computer or microcontroller that processes electronic signals representing one (“on”) or zero (“off”). Each “on” or “off” state is a bit (binary digit), and eight bits make a byte. These devices interpret patterns of bits to perform computation and control functions in everything from smartphones and watches to refrigerators and automobiles.",FIT152 - Topic 3: Hardware and Digital Devices (PR),
Describe how bit-width affects a digital device’s performance.,"Bit-width refers to how many bits a processor can handle simultaneously. Early PCs processed 8 bits at once; modern CPUs may process 64 or 128 bits in parallel. A larger bit-width allows more data to be processed per clock cycle, improving overall performance and enabling more complex operations.",FIT152 - Topic 3: Hardware and Digital Devices (PR),
Compare the base-ten (decimal) numbering system to the base-two (binary) system.,"Decimal (base-ten): each digit represents a power of ten (10⁰, 10¹, 10², etc.); for example, 1 0 1 0₁₀  (1×10³)+(0×10²)+(1×10¹)+(0×10⁰)  1010.
– Binary (base-two): each digit represents a power of two (2⁰, 2¹, 2², etc.); for example, 1 0 1 0₂  (1×2³)+(0×2²)+(1×2¹)+(0×2⁰)  8+0+2+0  10₁₀. Computers use binary because electronic circuits easily distinguish two states (on/off).",FIT152 - Topic 3: Hardware and Digital Devices (PR),

– Energy production and distribution systems (for example power grids)
– Communication systems (for example cellular networks, the Internet)
– Industrial control systems (for example manufacturing assembly lines)",FIT152 - Topic 3: Systems Architecture and Emergence (PR),
Explain why modern engineered systems are characterized by both high complexity and strong interdependence.,"Modern systems integrate many subsystems and components whose behaviors interact in non-linear ways. Increased functionality and connectivity (for example digital control in automobiles, smart grids) mean that a change or failure in one part can propagate, making the overall system behavior harder to predict and control.",FIT152 - Topic 3: Systems Architecture and Emergence (PR),
Define the concept of emergence in system integration and illustrate it with the brick-and-wall example.,"Emergence is when an integrated system exhibits properties not present in its individual parts. In the brick-and-wall example:
– A brick alone provides structural support and light absorption.
– A wall of unbonded bricks only absorbs light.
– A properly constructed wall “emerges” with new properties (for example shape, windows that allow light passage) that cannot be deduced from a single brick’s properties.",FIT152 - Topic 3: Systems Architecture and Emergence (PR),
Why is a dedicated system architect essential for complex system design?,"Controlling individual components does not guarantee control of the whole system due to emergent behaviors. A system architect oversees the high-level integration model, ensuring coherent interconnection of subsystems, managing emergence, and aligning the overall structure with requirements and constraints. Without this role, organizations risk uncontrolled complexity and unpredictable system behaviors.",FIT152 - Topic 3: Systems Architecture and Emergence (PR),
Describe one challenge in developing a holistic “science of systems” (systemics).,"Systemics must integrate knowledge from many disciplines (for example engineering, computer science, organizational theory), each with its own methods and terminology. Bringing these together into coherent models that capture emergence and interdependence is difficult, as traditional disciplines focus on optimizing subsystems rather than entire integrated systems.",FIT152 - Topic 3: Systems Architecture and Emergence (PR),
Summarize how the foreword positions “systemics” as a new scientific and technical discipline.,"Systemics is proposed as the rigorous study of engineered systems’ architecture, complexity and emergence. It extends beyond component optimization to address integration processes, require new modeling paradigms and cross-disciplinary collaboration, and demands formal recognition (for example system architect roles, academic programs) to tackle modern systemic challenges.",FIT152 - Topic 3: Systems Architecture and Emergence (PR),
Explain what differentiates a “system” from a mere group of interacting elements.,"A system is created by applying an integration operator to disparate elements, producing a unique unit whose functional capabilities—its “service contract” exposed via external interfaces—emerge only at the system level. Unlike a simple group, the system’s new functions are more than the sum of its parts and can be used without knowledge of its internal construction.",FIT152 - Topic 3: System Integration and Emergence (PR),

The components share a common exchange model (for example information protocols) that enables coordination without tight coupling.",FIT152 - Topic 3: System Integration and Emergence (PR),
Summarize why the 1990s–2010s marked a revolution in system architecture.,"Advances in miniaturization and component integration in the 1980s enabled distributed computation. In the 1990s, defense and security applications adopted loosely coupled “system of systems” architectures. With the Internet and World Wide Web becoming ubiquitous in the 2000s, this integration motif—relying on shared information exchange models—became central across industries, amplifying system complexity and interdependence.",FIT152 - Topic 3: System Integration and Emergence (PR),
Explain the role of an “exchange model” in system integration.,"An exchange model defines the common information structures and protocols that allow heterogeneous components or subsystems to interoperate and be integrable. By standardizing data formats, messages or interfaces, the exchange model ensures that the integration operator can bind parts into a coherent system or system of systems.",FIT152 - Topic 3: System Integration and Emergence (PR),
Discuss why error management is now a core concern in complex system design.,"As systems grow in complexity—especially their functional (software) components—errors become inevitable at scale. These faults can cause malfunctions with severe consequences. System safety must therefore be built in, designing architectures that are robust (resist faults) and resilient (recover from faults), ensuring autonomy and dependable operation under real-world hazards.",FIT152 - Topic 3: System Integration and Emergence (PR),
Define cybernetics as introduced by Norbert Wiener.,"Cybernetics is the science of control and communication in animals and machines.

Explain the concept of a metamodel and its relevance in cybernetics.,"A metamodel is an abstract model of a model.

Contrast the United States and France in early cybernetic adoption.,"United States: Cybernetics was integrated into engineering via MIT’s SAGE, Forrester’s Industrial Dynamics, systems engineering programs and the “Fifth Discipline.”
